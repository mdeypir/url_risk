This repository is about our proposed URL risk metrics including both our implementations and used datasets in our paper.

-These Matlab codes were implemented by Mahmood Deypir, mdeypir@gmail.com. 

-The implementations of our proposed url risk metrics including FRU and NRU described in paper:
Deypir, M., & Zoughi, T. (2024). "Novel Security Metrics for Identifying Risky Unified Resource Locators (URLs)", 
Iranian Journal of Science and Technology, Transactions of Electrical Engineering, 1-19. 

-As described in our paper datasets of this repository were obtained from other resources. Only some modifications, pre-processings, 
and convertion to Matlab format were applied on datasets.
